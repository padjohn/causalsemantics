## Overview

Causal Semantics ($S_C$) is a computational framework for extracting and analyzing causal relations from natural language text. It bridges three research traditions:

- **Logical theories** differentiating between monocausal and polycausal structures
- **Linguistic analyses** identifying semantic dimensions like promoting vs. inhibiting influences
- **Computational methods** that scale, but tend to reduce relations to binary cause-effect pairs

In short, $S_C$ aims to extract and represent causal attributions:

> *Climate change causes species extinction.*  

and represent them as graphs:

$$ \text{Climate change} \xrightarrow{+1} \text{Species extinction} $$

## Core Innovation

The framework models causal relations as **$(C, E, I)$ tuples**, where:

- $C$ ([Cause]{.smallcaps}): The causing entity
- $E$ ([Effect]{.smallcaps}): The affected entity  
- $I$ ([Influence]{.smallcaps}): A signed scalar $\in [-1, +1]$ encoding:
  - **Polarity** (sign): Promoting ($+$) vs. inhibiting ($−$) influence
  - **Salience** (magnitude): Monocausal ($|I|=1.0$) vs. polycausal ($|I|<1.0$) attribution

This representation enables:

1. **Semantic precision**: Capturing the direction and strength of a causal attribution
2. **Quantitative aggregation**: Accumulating attributions into weighted causal networks
3. **Graph-based analysis**: Visualizing discourse dynamics as Attributional Causal Graphs (ACGs)

## Example

Consider these sentences from environmental discourse:

> *Climate change causes species extinction.*  
> $(C_\text{climate change}, E_\text{species extinction}, I_{+1.0})$

> *Conservation measures reduce forest dieback.*  
> $(C_\text{conservation measures}, E_\text{forest dieback}, I_{-0.5})$

The first example expresses a promoting, monocausal relation ($I=+1.0$), while the second expresses an inhibiting, contributory relation ($I=-0.5$).

## Architecture

The framework consists of three main modules:

graph LR
    A[Text Input] --> B1[Annotation]
    A[Text Input] --> B2[C-BERT]

    B1 --> C[Tuple-Construction]
    B2 --> C

    C --> D[Aggregation]
    D --> E[ACG]
    
    E --> D2[Visualization]
    E --> D3[Analysis]
```

## Applications

This framework has been applied to a German **Environmental corpus** (1990-2022) to:

- analyze responsibility attributions in biodiversity debates [@johnson2026causalsemantics]
- disambiguate references to *forest diebacks* [@johnson2026waldsterben2]
