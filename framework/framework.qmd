## Logic, Language & Computation

Causal Semantics integrates insights from three research areas that have largely operated independently:

### 1. Philosophical Causal Theories

Philosophical accounts differentiate between:  

- **Monocausal structures**:
  - A cause is both *sufficient* and *necessary* 
- **Polycausal structures**:
  - A cause can be *sufficient*
    - *Where there's fire, there is smoke.*
    - *If*, *when*
  - A cause can be *necessary*
    - *No smoke without a fire.*
    - *If and only if*, *only*

Yet these theories remain abstract and haven't been operationalized for natural language analysis.

**Key references**: [@Mackie1965], [@Lewis1973Causation], [@pearl2000], [@halpern2016]  
 
### 2. Linguistic Semantics

Linguistic analyses identify crucial semantic dimensions:  

- **Polarity**: Promoting or inhibiting influences [@cruse1986]
- **Modality**: Factive or hypothetical causation [@fabricius2000]
- **Discourse functions**: Causal attributions as argumentative tool [@toulmin1958]

Yet these studies remain limited to small, qualitatively analyzed corpora. 

### 3. Computational Causal Extraction  

NLP systems scale to large text collections but typically:

- Reduce causality to binary [Cause]{.smallcaps}-[Effect]{.smallcaps} pairs
- Ignore semantic nuances like strength or direction
- Lack discourse sensitivity

**Key references**: [@dunietz-etal-2017-because], [@rehbein2017], [@wu2025ckgeie]

## The Integration

Causal Semantics bridges these traditions by:

1. **Formalizing** philosophical distinctions (mono- vs. polycausal) as quantifiable salience values  
2. **Enriching** computational extraction with semantic dimensions (polarity, salience)  
3. **Scaling** linguistic insights through automated extraction pipelines  

The result is a framework that is:

- **Semantically enriched**: Captures nuanced attributions  
- **Computationally tractable**: Scales to millions of sentences  

## $(C, E, I)$ Cause, Effect & Influence

The framework models causal relations as triples:

$$
R = (C, E, I)
$$
where:  

* $C$ ([**Cause**]{.smallcaps}): The causing entity  
* $E$ ([**Effect**]{.smallcaps}): The affected entity  
* $I$ ([**Influence**]{.smallcaps}): A signed scalar $\in [-1, +1]$ encoding:  
    + $\pm$ ([**Polarity**]{.smallcaps}) : promoting ($+$) or inhibiting ($−$)  
    + $||I||$ ([**Salience**]{.smallcaps}): monocausal ($1.0$) or polycausal ($<1.0$)

<!-- **See**: [Understanding (C,E,I) Tuples](tuples.qmd) for detailed explanation. -->

## Two Core Dimensions

### Polarity: Direction

Does the cause promote or inhibit the effect?

- **Promoting** ($+$): $C$ increases the probability/intensity of $E$
  - *Climate change causes species extinction*
- **Inhibiting** ($−$): $C$ decreases the probability/intensity of $E$
  - *Conservation prevents species extinction*

Linguistically realized through:

- Antonym verb pairs (*increase/reduce*, *cause/prevent*)
- Nominal indicators (*cause* vs. *prevention*)
- Prepositional markers (*for* vs. *against*)

<!-- **See**: [Polarity section](tuples.qmd#sec-polarity) for examples and analysis. -->

### Salience: Magnitude

How strong is this cause relative to all factors?

- **Monocausal** ($|I| = 1.0$): Sole or exclusive factor
  - *X is the cause of Y*
- **Prioritized** ($|I| = 0.75$): Dominant but not exclusive
  - *Mainly X causes Y*
- **Distributed** ($||I|| = 0.5$): One of several equal factors
  - *X contributes to Y*, *X and Y cause Z*

Linguistically realized through:

- Determination (*the* vs. *a* cause)
- Composition (*main cause*, *partial cause*)
- Distribution markers (*among others*, *also*)

<!-- **See**: [Salience section](tuples.qmd#sec-salience) for computation methods. -->

## From Tuples to Graphs

Individual $(C, E, I)$ tuples aggregate into **Attributional Causal Graphs** (ACGs):

- **Nodes**: Entities ($C$ and $E$ values)
- **Edges**: Weighted, directed connections with $I$ as weight
- **Properties**: 
  - Positive edges ($I > 0$): promoting factors
  - Negative edges ($I < 0$): inhibiting factors
  - Edge weights = aggregated evidence across multiple texts

ACGs enable:

- Network analysis of discourse structure
- Identification of central vs. peripheral causes
- Temporal tracking of attribution shifts

<!-- **See**: [ACG Theory](acg-theory.qmd) for graph-theoretic foundations. -->

## Applications

The framework reveals:

### 1. Argumentation Patterns
- Which entities are positioned as causes vs. effects?
- Are attributions monocausal (simplified) or polycausal (nuanced)?
- What role do inhibiting relations play (solutions vs. problems)?

### 2. Temporal Dynamics
- How do causal attributions shift over time?
- When do new causes enter discourse?
- When do attributions strengthen or weaken?

### 3. Responsibility Distribution
- Which actors are attributed causal agency?
- How is responsibility distributed across entities?
- What patterns of blame or credit emerge?
